# volusion v1 api client for nodejs

Integrate with the [Volusion V1 API](https://app.apiary.io/volusionv1adminapi/editor).

## Install

Use this package in your project by doing:

```bash
npm install @volusion/v1-api
```


## Get Started

```js
// instantiate the client 
const v1Client = require('@volusion/v1-api');
const v1 = new v1Client({
    apiKey: "D29mVUp2nJABPdMNZDfAdzNAeHz9qLri", // replace with your key
    baseUrl: "https://www.yourdomain.com"
});

// call an endpoint
const data = await v1.getOrders();

// use the data
const order = data.items[0]; // for this sample, let's look at the first order in the array

```

## Security Tip

We recommend setting an environment variable in your project called `V1_API_KEY`.

You probably already know how to do this using popular packages like [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) or similar to manage environment variables. But if not, you can quickly set your environment variables locally by simply running the following command which sets the environment variable for the duration of your terminal session: `export V1_API_KEY="yourkeyhere"` 
So just run that before you run `npm start` or similar. You can check the value of your environment variable in that specific terminal session by doing `echo "$V1_API_KEY"`.


```js
// when you instantiate the client, get the key from an environment variable
const v1Client = require('@volusion/v1-api');
const v1 = new v1Client({
    apiKey: process.env.V1_API_KEY, // ðŸ‘ˆ best practice âœ¨
    baseUrl: "https://www.yourdomain.com"
});
```
